# vEnqueuer
An javascript asynchronous code enqueuer. Perfect for queue up repetitive i/o tasks that should be executed in order, in a way that the end of one task calls the next in the queue, all this asynchronously, of course. You just need to register the function which you want queue up and call vEnqueuer's methods like enqueue or trigger.
